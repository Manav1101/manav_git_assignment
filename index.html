            any team. He retired in 1994, as the first player to take 200 ODI wickets, and holding the world record for
            the highest number of wickets taken in Test cricket, a record subsequently broken by Courtney Walsh in
            2000.Kapil Dev held the record for the highest individual score (175*) scored by a batsman batting at number
            5 or lower in ODIs until 2023, when it was superseded by Glenn Maxwell. He was also a part of the Indian
            squad which won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket.</p>
         <p>After retiring, he coached the Indian national team between September 1999 and September 2000.</p>
